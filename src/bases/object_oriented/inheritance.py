Single Inheritance
    - In single inheritance, a child class derives from one parent class.

Multi-Level Inheritance
In multi-level inheritance, a child class inherits from a parent class, and another child class inherits from that child class.

Method Resolution Order (MRO)

In Python, the Method Resolution Order (MRO) determines the order in which classes are searched for methods and attributes. It is especially important in multiple inheritance.
