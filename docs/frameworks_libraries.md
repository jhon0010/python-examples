# ADR 1: Use of FastAPI, Uvicorn, and MongoDB for Web Application Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our project requires the development of a high-performance, scalable web application with real-time data processing capabilities. We need a solution that can handle asynchronous processing efficiently and is suitable for rapid development and iteration.

## Decision
We have decided to use the following technologies:

- **FastAPI:** A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python, based on standard Python type hints.
- **Uvicorn:** An ASGI server for Python, known for its performance and support for asynchronous processing.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database that offers flexibility, scalability, and efficient handling of large amounts of data.

## Considerations

### FastAPI
- **Advantages:**
  - FastAPI is built on Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts, making it fast and efficient.
  - It supports asynchronous request handling and is ideal for high-traffic applications.
  - It automatically generates interactive API documentation.
  - It's easy to use and has built-in support for data validation and serialization.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Being a relatively new framework, it might have a smaller community and fewer resources compared to more established frameworks like Django or Flask.

### Uvicorn
- **Advantages:**
  - Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, ideal for running asynchronous Python web applications.
  - It supports HTTP/1.1 and WebSockets.
  - It's lightweight and easy to integrate with FastAPI.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - As a standalone server, it might not have all the features provided by more comprehensive server solutions like Gunicorn combined with Nginx.

### MongoDB
- **Advantages:**
  - Offers high performance and scalability.
  - Flexible schema design that can evolve with the application's needs.
  - Strong support for aggregations and complex queries.

- **Disadvantages:**
  - Being a NoSQL database, it might not be suitable for applications that require complex transactions and joins.

## Consequences
- This combination of technologies will allow us to build a highly efficient, scalable application capable of handling real-time data processing and complex operations.
- The choice of these modern technologies positions our application for future growth and ensures that we are working with a stack that aligns with current industry trends.
